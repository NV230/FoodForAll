                    <br>
                    <p class="display-6"> The Food For All program is an initiative that aims to tackle a global problem: hunger.  Across the  world almost 9% of the population goes hungry which equates to roughly 690 million people per day.  Numerous factors such as economic position or location are attributed to this alarming statisic.  Thankfully, due to the generous and life-saving services provided by food banks, people are able to get quality meals on their tables.  However, many of the needy cannot attain these foods due to them not knowing where their nearest foodbank is.  For the purposes of our project, we decided to use a UK-based API to help residents of the United Kingdom locate food.              
                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="display-6"> The program itself is based on Java and uses the <a href="https://github.com/givefood/data">Give Food API</a> to attain information.  Currently, we are in the process of making our product more user-friendly (creation of an app), however it is still fully operational.  We believe that our product can immensely help individuals as it provides them with quick, accurate, and realtime results.
